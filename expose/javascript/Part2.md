1.) The code will print 3. This is because the for loop will run when the value of i is 0, 1 and 2 and stops when it is incremented to 3.
Also, the var variable can be accesed outside of the scope of the block that it is a part of. 

2.) Once again, the last iteration of the for loop was when is was calculating the discount of the value 300. The value generated was 150. 
Also, the var variable can be accesed outside of the scope of the block that it is a part of. 

3.) Once again, the last iteration of the for loop was when is was calculating the discount of the value 300. The value generated was 150. 
Also, the var variable can be accesed outside of the scope of the block that it is a part of. 

4.) [ 50, 100, 150 ]
This is because it returns an array that logs all the discounted proces. Once again, the variable discounted was declared as a var type. 

5.) This would generate an error. This is because you are trying to access the variable outside the scope in which it is defined: the for loop

6.) This would generate an error. This is because you are trying to access the variable outside the scope in which it is defined: the for loop

7.) The code would output 150. This is because the variable was defined in the same scope. 

8.) [ 50, 100, 150 ]
This is because it returns an array that logs all the discounted proces. Once again, the variable discounted was declared as a let type. However, the
function returned it the variable within the scope that it wqas declared. 

9.) This would return an error because the variable i was defined with the let keyword. This mean that it can not be accessed outside the scope: the for loop. 

10.) This would print 3. This is because we did not try to change the value of the const variable. Also we accessed it within the same scope. 

11.) [ 50, 100, 150 ]
This is because all the variables were accessed within their respective scopes and we didnt try to change the value of the const variable. 

12.) 
  A.) alert(student.name);
  B.) alert(student["Grad Year"]);
  C.) student.greeting();
  D.) var newVar = student["Favorite Teacher"];
      alert(newVar.name)
  E.) var newVar = student.courseLoad;
      newVar[0];
      
13.)
  A.) 32. This is because integers map to their exact string representation
  B.) 1. This is because the string is converted to a number
  C.) 3. This is because null becomes 0
  D.) 3null. This is becasue the null is converted to a string 
  E.) 4. This is because the boolean is converted into an integer
  F.) 0. This is because both values are converted into integers. 
  G.) 3undefined. This is because undefined is converted into a string
  H.) NaN. This is because undefined becomes NaN
  
14.) 
  A.) True. THis is because the string is converted to a number
  B.) False. This is because 12 is lexicographically lesser
  C.) True. The string is converted to a number
  D.) False. They are a different type
  E.) False. True gets coverted to 1 which is not 2
  F.) True. Boolean(2) is true and the same data type
  
15.) === does a type check while == does not

17.) [ 2, 4, 6 ]
The function modify array contains a for loop and an empty array. The for loop helps iterate through the array and it calls the function doSomething doubles the result. The doubled result is then added to the array.
